# Bookwork Repo

(TODO: When I reach projects in PCC, put them all in a folder called "Part 1: Basics")

This is a personal repo for my own learning, containing programming exercises and notes.

Instead of a separate repository for every time I begin working through a textbook,
this repository will contain all the exercises / notes. Projects will still be given their own repositories.

Repo structure:

    BookworkRootDir
        ReadmeOverview.md <--(You are here)---
        Book 1
            ReadmeBook.md
            DataForBook
                Datasets.csv
                MiscAssets.png
            Ch1
                ReadmeChapterRecap.md
                file1.py
                file2.r
            Ch2
                Readmechapterrecap.md
                file1.py
                file2.r
        Book 2
            ReadmeBook.md
            DataForBook
                Datasets.csv

                file1.py
                file2.r

I have collected 26 repos over the course of learning to code, going on the Strive bootcamp and coming back,
it's a bit of a mess, old projects *may* get looked at and repurposed but I'm viewing this as a fresh start, I am quite
out of practice at the time of writing (18/03/2024) but my health has improved significantly so am happy to start again :)
