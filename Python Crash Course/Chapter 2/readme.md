# Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types

 This chapter introduces variables, what they are and how to use 'em. 
 
Also introduced are some useful .methods() and tricks for string manipulation, some info on how python handles numbers, and finally the often neglected #comment!

The book also includes a copy of [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) which is a nice summary of Python's style of coding. 


```python
# Code Covered

variable = "Text\t\n"
print(variable)
variable.upper().lower().title()
variable.lstrip().rstrip().strip()
number = 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5 ** 6



```
