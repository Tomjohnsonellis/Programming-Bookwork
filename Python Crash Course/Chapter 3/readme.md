# Chapter 3 - Introducing Lists

Lists are a core python concept, there are "lists" of data items in an order!

E.g. The numbers 1 to 100, Every customer who has bought a certain item, every word used in the works of shakespeare, 3 different fruits...

But you can also store a bunch of different types of things in the same list if you want to, numbers, text, dates, other lists, anything.

```python
# Code Covered

a_list = [1,2,3]
a_list.pop(1)
a_list.append(a_list[-1])
a_list.insert(0,"Zero")
```
