# Chapter 1: Getting Started

The books is targeted towards complete beginners so it covers how to install python on each major OS (Win/Lin/Mac)

It recommends [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) as a text editor but I have some prior experience so I will be using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

The book also enourages you to make a typo then read the error message, a **very** important skill!

As is tradition for programmers, we write a "hello world", mine also tells me what version of python I'm running.
